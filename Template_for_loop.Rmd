We are the research team of the University of Oviedo that has been working on your field for the last year. Firstly, we would like to thank you bla bla bla 

We have reported a total of **34 bird species** throughout the year and bla bla bla . We have also recorded the rates of predation by (*Scientific name*) in your crop bla bla bla 

We would like to share with you a summary of the main results of our research in your field.


\vspace{16pt} 
<!-- Include some space before -->
<font size="20"> **Summary of results** </font>
<!-- You may want to use headings instead of the aboveline -->


Talk a little bit about your protocols. Maybe you want to add some links to certain products or tools that you have used. This is an example of how to share a url [pheromone dispenser.](https://www.e-econex.net/es/para-plagas-agricolas/econex-cydia-pomonella-2-mg-60-dias-225.html)
<!-- Whenever you wan to make a link to a certain issue in [] is the text you want to use and in () the link -->

You may want to include a picture to exemplify fieldwork. You need to have the picture in the folder where your R project is. It is better that you have all pictures in pdf so that the final pdf is not too heavy. This is an example of our own fieldwork


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', out.height= '50%', fig.align="center",fig.cap= "Field work for identificaction of XXX pest (A) trunk of tree with a carton to capture worms, (B) pitfall to capture moths"}
knitr::include_graphics("Field_work.pdf")
#When adding a figure you can specify the size with out.width and weight, where do tou want it and what do you want to add in the difure caption
```

The following figure shows the trends of predation rates by *Whatever name* throughout the year. 

<!-- Text in *XXX* will be in italics, text in **XXX** will be in bold. -->


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', out.height= '50%', fig.align="center",fig.cap= "Rates of whatever across 2024 in your field. Points depict values in surveys."}
tmp_rates = rates[which(rates$id == v),]
tmp_rates$date = as.Date(tmp_rates$date)
ggplot(data=tmp_rates, aes(x = date, y = Rate_of_X)) +
    geom_line(linewidth= 0.7)+
    geom_point(size= 2, alpha = 0.5)+
    ylab("Rates of whatever (prop)")+
    xlab("")+
    theme_classic()+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 12), 
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 12))+
    theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black"),
          axis.line.y = element_line(color="black"))+
    theme(axis.title=element_text(size=14))
```
Within your crop, we compared the abundance of X in local areas with XXX and without this management (control). Here we show a comparison between them. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', out.height= '50%', fig.align="center",fig.cap= "Abundance of whatever (number of individuals observed at the end of 2024) in plots within your field with X management and without it (control). Points depict observed values. Boxes represent the range of most frequent observed values and line the median (similar to average values)"}
tmp_tr = treat[which(treat$id == v),]

ggplot(tmp_tr, aes(x=plot, y=abundance_of_X)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(shape=16, size = 3, alpha = 0.5, position=position_jitter(0.1))+
  ylab("Abundance of whatever")+
  xlab("")+
  theme_classic()+
    theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "black", size = 12))+
    theme(axis.line = element_line(color="black"))+
    theme(axis.title=element_text(size=14))
```

Finally, we would like to share with you the bird species found in your field.

Bla bla bla (in case you want to thank again), provide information about your funding etc. I usually like to provide links to all this data. And finally provide a link to our research group page.
